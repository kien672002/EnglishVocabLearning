Enter the word to be added and the definition, for example, in the corresponding lines (although there is **no feature that uses the example entry yet**, if it does not, it will **not be able** to add the word)

Added words will be saved in **data.csv** file,

Words with less correct answers will appear more often than words with more correct answers
